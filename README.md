# **Introduction**

Presently, workplace absenteeism is defined as the non-attendance of an employee from their duties, arising from either tardiness or expected service interruptions. It currently stands as a significant challenge confronting companies and organizations.

Workplace absenteeism is undesirable for both companies and associations, exerting a detrimental influence on productivity and the overall organizational atmosphere. The general workforce tends to feel demotivated due to colleagues' absences, leading to an increased workload for those present and resulting in financial losses for companies.

The absence of an employee can create a void on a particular day, affecting aspects such as a production line, the progress of a project, or the decision-making process.

The database was created with records of absenteeism at work from July 2007 to July 2010 at a courier company in Brazil. The dataset allows for various attribute novations and attribute deletions, or a modification of the attribute type (categorical, integer or real) dependent on the purpose of the search.

**Health Chronicles:** Medical consultations lead the absenteeism saga, impacting 20% of the workforce. Dental consultations claim the second spot, affecting 15% of employees. Musculoskeletal and connective tissue issues account for 8% of absenteeism.

**Weekday Symphony:** Mondays showcase elevated absenteeism rates, attributed to post-weekend blues, reluctance, or health issues.

**Seasonal Absence Ballet:** Spring sees the highest absenteeism at 189 employees, followed by winter (177), autumn (173), and summer (167).
